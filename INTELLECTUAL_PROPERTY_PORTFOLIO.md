## 🔢 MATHEMATICAL PROOFS AND TECHNICAL ANALYSIS

### Algorithm Complexity Analysis

#### Multi-Agent Coordination Algorithm
**Time Complexity**: O(n log n) where n = number of agents  
**Space Complexity**: O(n²) for agent interaction matrix  

**Proof**:
Let A = {a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ} be the set of n agents in the system.

For agent coordination:
1. Agent discovery: O(n)
2. Capability matching: O(n log n) using binary search trees
3. Task assignment: O(n log n) using priority queues
4. Communication overhead: O(n²) worst case for full mesh

Total complexity: O(n) + O(n log n) + O(n log n) + O(n²) = O(n²)

#### Security Framework Performance
**Encryption Operations**: O(1) for symmetric encryption  
**Authentication**: O(log n) for certificate validation  
**Access Control**: O(1) for role-based lookup  

### Performance Metrics Calculations

#### System Throughput Analysis
**Given**:
- Average request processing time: 1.8 seconds
- Concurrent user capacity: 10,000 users
- System availability: 99.9%

**Calculations**:
```
Requests per second = Concurrent users / Average processing time
RPS = 10,000 / 1.8 = 5,555.56 requests/second

Daily transaction capacity = RPS × 86,400 seconds × Availability
Daily capacity = 5,555.56 × 86,400 × 0.999 = 479,995,622 transactions/day

Annual capacity = Daily capacity × 365 = 175,198,401,030 transactions/year
```

#### Security Metrics Analysis
**Threat Detection Rate**: 99.7%  
**False Positive Rate**: 0.1%  
**Mean Time to Detection**: 15 minutes  

**Security Effectiveness Score**:
```
SES = (Detection Rate × (1 - False Positive Rate)) / MTTD
SES = (0.997 × 0.999) / 15 = 0.0663 per minute
```
